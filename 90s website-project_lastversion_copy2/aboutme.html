          So as it said on the first page I'm Daniel. I am 42 years old and I
          live in a town called Ã…kersberga, just north of Stockholm in Sweden.
        </p>
        <p>I like computers, music, technology and being in the nature</p>
        <p>
          I like alot to take things apart and see what they look like on the
          inside.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've fixed alot of things in my life, everything from TV's to watches.
